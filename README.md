Sure, here's a template for a README.md for your TDD studies project in Go, using development containers. You can customize this template according to the specifics of your project.

```markdown
# TDD Studies in Go

This project is focused on learning and practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Go. It uses development containers to ensure a consistent development environment across different setups.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up your project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Visual Studio Code
- Remote - Containers extension for VS Code

### Setting Up Your Development Container

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tdd-studies-go.git
    cd tdd-studies-go
    ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code:**

    Launch VS Code, go to the **File** menu, and select **Open Folder**. Select the cloned directory.

3. **Reopen in Container:**

    With the project open in VS Code, you'll be prompted to reopen the project in a container. If not, you can open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.

    This step will build your development container the first time it's executed, which may take a few minutes.

### Running the Tests

To run your tests, open a terminal in VS Code (which will be within your development container) and execute:

```bash
go test ./...
```

This command runs all tests in your project.

## Structure

- **/cmd**: Main applications for this project.
- **/pkg**: Library code that can be used by other applications.
- **.devcontainer**: Configuration files for the development container.

This README aims to get you started with a basic structure and understanding of documenting a project that uses development containers and focuses on TDD in Go.
